# Neural Noodle
Neural Doodle implementation for New Trends in Neural Calculations project course on Wrocław University of Technology, implemented during March-May 2017.

Main implementation in nss.py file.

As project was modified a lot during last phase of implementation, quality of code is not state of the art. Unfortunatelly we prefered to pass the course than keep clean, beautiful code. 

And after completing it we didn't care anymore. :)
